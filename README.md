# SambaStack!

Welcome to Brazil's project: SambaStack!

I was lucky enough to be in Brazil for the world famous carnival celebrations, and it did not disappoint! Full of dancing, colours, and, of course, samba!

Inspired by all of the traditional Brazilian instruments that come together to make an iconic and energetic samba song, I created this app so that you could have a go at bringing a beat to life too. I've never worked with music on apps before, so this was a chance to challenge myself and learn about how it can be incorporated into a NextJS project.

I used [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) to find and download my sample sounds, and [tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) in the code to handle playing and recording them.

Please enjoy listening to the traditional instruments used in Brazilian carnival music, and have a go at recording your own mix!
